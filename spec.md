# Self Evaluation Tool Specification

## Overview
This web application is a self-evaluation tool that allows users to assess their personality traits and work on self-improvement. The app will start with a landing page and use OAuth with a custom server for user authentication. Users can select from various personality trait categories, answer questionnaires, and receive feedback on areas for improvement.

## Key Features
1. Landing page
2. OAuth authentication with custom server (oauth.scramblesolutions.com)
3. User onboarding and continuous engagement flow
   - Selection of personality trait categories
   - Link to external questionnaires
   - Result entry and storage
   - Self-improvement suggestions and tracking

## Technical Stack
- Laravel (PHP framework)
- SQL database on AWS via Laravel Forge (initially)
- Future migration to Coolify

## Detailed Specifications

### 1. Landing Page
- Create an engaging and informative landing page that introduces the self-evaluation tool
- Include a clear call-to-action for user registration/login

### 2. Authentication
- Implement OAuth authentication using oauth.scramblesolutions.com
- Ensure secure user login and registration process

### 3. User Onboarding and Engagement
- After first login, guide users through a selection process for personality trait categories
- Present personality trait categories for users to choose from, including:
  - Big Five
  - MBTI
  - Enneagram
  - Attachment Theory Styles
- Allow users to select as many categories as they want, at any time
- Link users to existing external questionnaires for each selected category
- Enable users to return and enter their results at their convenience

### 4. User Dashboard
- Display a list of all available personality trait categories
- Show which categories the user has completed and which are still pending
- Provide options to enter results for pending categories or revisit completed ones
- Include a progress tracker showing the percentage of completed assessments

### 5. Self-Improvement Features
- For each personality trait category:
  - Provide red flags and green flags based on user's results
  - Offer tips and suggestions for self-improvement
  - Allow users to select areas they're already working on or want to improve
  - Track user's progress and improvements over time

### 6. Data Management and Privacy
- Implement strict privacy measures as the top priority
- Use standard Laravel best practices for data security
- Store user data in a SQL database on AWS, managed via Laravel Forge
- Plan for future migration to Coolify for enhanced privacy and control

### 7. Reporting and Visualization
- Implement a percentage graph showing user's progress in completing assessments
- Develop visualizations for individual trait category results
- Create reports that highlight areas of strength and potential improvement

### 8. Future Features
- Develop a dating compatibility layer using the personality trait data
- Implement social features for sharing results or comparing with friends (with privacy controls)

### 9. Mobile Responsiveness
- Ensure the web application is fully responsive and usable on mobile devices

## Questions and Areas for Further Exploration

1. How will we handle updates or changes to external questionnaires?
2. What specific self-improvement metrics or milestones should we track for users?
3. How can we gamify the self-improvement process to increase user engagement?
4. What kind of notification system should we implement to encourage users to complete pending assessments or work on their improvement areas?
5. How will we approach the development of the dating compatibility layer?
6. Should we consider integrating with any third-party self-improvement or habit-tracking apps?
7. What measures can we take to encourage honest answers from users, given that the tool is not scientifically validated?
8. How can we provide value to users who may not score "well" on certain traits but are not necessarily looking to change those aspects of themselves?

## Next Steps
1. Set up the Laravel project structure
2. Design and implement the landing page
3. Configure OAuth authentication with oauth.scramblesolutions.com
4. Develop the user onboarding flow for trait category selection
5. Create database schemas for user profiles, selected trait categories, and assessment results
6. Implement the user dashboard with progress tracking
7. Develop the self-improvement suggestion and tracking system
8. Design and implement data visualizations and reports
9. Ensure mobile responsiveness throughout the application
10. Implement privacy and security measures
11. Plan for future features (dating compatibility, social features)

## Development Priorities
1. User authentication and basic profile management
2. Personality trait category selection and external questionnaire linking
3. Result entry and storage system
4. User dashboard with progress tracking
5. Self-improvement suggestions and tracking features
6. Data visualization and reporting
7. Mobile responsiveness
8. Advanced privacy and security measures
9. Future features (dating compatibility, social features)
